My name is Alex, I live in the UK and work as a software engineer at a bioinformatics company based near Cambridge.

This is a blog where I investigate or explain, with varying degrees of rigour, questions/ideas/things that I've stumbled across and found intriguing.

Much of the content here is programming focused, but I've meandered through various studies and careers so expect occasional excursions down unrelated paths.
