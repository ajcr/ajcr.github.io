Welcome to the simple blog where I occasionaly write about questions that have distracted me, or summarise any of my mini-projects that were not abject failures.

To get more of an idea about who I am in real life, click any of the links at the foot of the page.

If you don't feel like clicking, here are three snippets:

- I used to spend a lot of time drawing and attended several art courses before going to university to study "various other things".

- I found that a good way to learn how *not* to write stupid algorithms is to attempt as many of the maddeningly compelling problems posed on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) as possible:

- My collection of second-hand novels grows steadily. I don't have a favourite author as such, but [Southern Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Gothic) with its stories about hideous and deeply unlikeable people is a contenter for my favourite genre.
