My name is Alex, I live in the UK and work as a software engineer at a drug-discovery/machine-learning company in the Cambridge area.

This is a blog where I try to investigate or explain, with varying levels of rigour, ideas and things that I've stumbled across and found interesting in some way.

Much of the content here is programming themed. I've meandered through other studies and careers though, so there'll maybe be excursions down unrelated paths.
