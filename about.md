My name is Alex and I live in the UK.

This is a blog where I write, with varying levels of rigour, about questions and ideas that I've stumbled across or experiments that I've tried.

The content here is largely programming themed (I currently work as a software engineer). I've meandered through various studies and industries though, so maybe expect excursions down other paths.
