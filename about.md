My name is Alex, I live in the UK and work as a software developer at a bioinformatics company based near Cambridge.

This is a blog where I investigate or explain, with varying degrees of rigour, questions and ideas that I've stumbled across and found intriguing.

Much of the content here is programming focused, but I've followed a convoluted path through numerous studies and careers to get here, so expect haphazard investigations in all directions.
