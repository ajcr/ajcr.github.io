Welcome to the simple blog where I occasionaly write about questions that have distracted me, or summarise any of my mini-projects that were not abject failures.

To get more of an idea about who I am in real life, click any of the links at the foot of the page.

Below are three snippets if you don't feel like clicking:

- I used to spend a lot of time drawing and attended several art courses before going to university to study "various other things".

- A good way to learn how not to write stupid algorithms is to attempt as many of the maddeningly compelling problems posed on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) as you can:

- My collection of second-hand novels grows steadily. I don't have a favourite author as such, but I'm usually drawn to stories about hideous and deeply unlikeable people. [Southern Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Gothic) is a particularly rewarding genre if you have similar tastes.
