title: 100 pandas puzzles
synopsis: Well, not quite 100 yet. You can find them at [github.com/ajcr/100-pandas-puzzles](https://github.com/ajcr/100-pandas-puzzles)

I've started compiling a list of short pandas puzzles of varying difficulty. You can find it over on GitHub [here](https://github.com/ajcr/100-pandas-puzzles).

There are already some great guides to pandas out there (not least in the official documents themselves) but nothing short and punchy to measure your skills against like, say, the [100 Numpy exercises](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100) project. Hopefully this goes a little way towards filling that gap.

As I write this post, the list of puzzles is only 34% complete. If you have any ideas for more exercises, please feel free to contribute!
