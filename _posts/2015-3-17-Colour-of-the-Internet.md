title: The colour of the Internet
---

What colour is the Internet? Probably green or blue, judging by the colours that appear most often in domain names.

The graph below shows 12 colours and the number of times each one appears in .com and .net domain names. It also indicates how often each colour is paired with another colour (they're used in the same domain name): a thick line indicates more than 1,000 pairings, medium between 100 and 1,000 pairings, and thin indicates less than 100 pairings.

You can see that green is often paired with blue, black is more popular than white, and that nobody really likes purple.
